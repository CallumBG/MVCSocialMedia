An online forum site for posting pictures or views on topics, it is a personal project to add to my understanding of .NET.

This project uses C# ASP.NET with an MVC style architecture, using entity framework to map to an SQL database of users and posts.


Key Features:

Personal accounts, along with email verification upon sign up.

Action authentication so that only verified users can create posts, and only they can edit/delete their own posts.

Includes user roles including an administrator role that can manage roles,users and posts.

Uses XUnit for thorough unit tests for controller and service actions.


Project Demo:
