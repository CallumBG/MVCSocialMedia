An online forum site for posting pictures or views on topics, it is a personal project to add to my understanding of .NET.

This project uses C# ASP.NET with an MVC style architecture, using entity framework to map to an SQL database of users and posts.


Key Features:

Personal accounts, along with email verification upon sign up.

Action authentication so that only verified users can create posts, and only they can edit/delete their own posts.

Includes user roles including an administrator role that can manage roles,users and posts.

Uses XUnit for thorough unit tests for controller and service actions.


Project Demo:

Here is the standard view of a user, has the ability to view, search for and create any posts as necessary however can only edit and delete their own posts.

Here is the admin view, similar however with added functionality of being able to view all roles/users and posts. Also this role can edit and delete any post on the site.
